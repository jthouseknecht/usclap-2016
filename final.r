# 1. Proportion claim, tested with p-score analysis

# Claim: we are attempting to demonstrate that the weather patterns tend to be
#   rainy on Good Friday, and sunny on Easter Sunday, more so than would be
#   expected based on random weather patterns.
#
# Notes:
#   - Since we have a substantical number of samples (50), we can just use the
#     regular proportion test.

# Compress each row of each weather sub-frame into a single {1,0} number
# indicating the overall weather for the day:
#
#   1 if the day was "rainy" (True)
#   0 if the day was "sunny" (False)
#
# We'll need the following function to compute the arithmatic mean of a
# vector, while ignoring NA (missing) values
mean.na <- function(v) mean(v[!is.na(v)])

# hours than `s'.

# into a single value {1,0}, indicating whether the weather goes from rain to
# sun between Good Friday and Easter:
#
#   1 if it is raining on Good Friday, and Sunny on Easter (True)
#   0 otherwise                                            (False)

# 2. Mean claim, tested with critical value analysis
#
# Claim: we collected data for 13 hours of the day, from 6am to 6pm, inclusive.
#   We wish to show that, statistically, it rains for more than half of those
#   thirteen hours each on Good Friday and Easter Sunday respectively.
#
# Notes:
#   - We are actually running two hypothesis test here; one considering the
#     hourly weather samples for Easter Sunday, and one considering the samples
#     for Good Friday.
#   - We don't know the distribution of weather, but since we have 50 samples
#     in each case, we can exploit the Central Limit Theorem and use a
#     large-sample test statistic.

# 3. Standard Deviation claim, tested with confidence interval analysis
#
# Claim: in addition to considering the average rainy hours in a day, there is
#   the question of standard deviation. We wish to demonstrate that 
#   standard deviation of rainy hours is not 2, that the weather on
#   Good Friday and Easter Sunday respectively varies either greater or less
#   than approximately Â±2 hours about the average.
